        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
        I donâ€™t know if there is such a thing an ideal job, because different people add unique 
        talents to each position. So anyone who tries hard enough and works 
        long enough can make a position into a meaningful creative outlet.  
        I wanted to make a difference in society. So any position that allows 
        me to help even one person will make me feel like I have made a positive 
        impact and fulfill my professional needs.
